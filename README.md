# Ai Teacher Assistant Tool 
This tool is built to help the teacher identify strengths, weaknesses, and any other corresponding patterns in students. It provides insights into areas of improvement for the students. This tool is meant to be associated with the student data throughout the education program and will be a very useful tool for every teacher.

## Features

- Helps teacher identify students weaknesses and strong points
- Provides a second opinion on how to help students
- Data is saved, so the AI will be able to help the next teacher with more info on the kid
- Can focus on each student individually and help the teacher find things that need to be done to help that student.
- Can detect patterns over a long period of time, so it can help the teacher find repeating problems with students(ex: bad at linear equations).
- Can generate custom flash cards specific to a student in order to help that student learn about subject they need to improve in.
- Teachers can set goals for students to achieve(tell the AI that a certain student has to get a certain grade) and the AI will help them achieve that goal.
- Can recommend extracurricular activities(ex:Science Olympiad, Math Olympiad, etc) to the students who are interested and/or capable in them.
